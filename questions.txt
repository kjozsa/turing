## Hungarian language skills-
please translate this to Hungarian: 'If it takes 1 hour to dry 15 towels under the Sun, how long will it take to dry 20 towels?' (ensure that the candidate responded in Hungarian. The Hungarian response's meaning should be 'Ha 15 törölköző egy óra alatt szárad meg a napon, akkor 20 törölköző hány óra alatt szárad meg?'. Trying to answer the question is a bad response, the task was to translate the question!)
